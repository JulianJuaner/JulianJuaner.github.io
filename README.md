## PROFILE
Hi! Here is ZHANG Yuechen, Julian. I am a year four undergraduate student in the Chinese Universiy of Hong Kong. As a beginner of computer science research, I am interested in Computer Graphics / Vision with Deep Learning. 
>Research interests: Style Transfer, Image Processing.

## EDUCATION
 - **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**
  >Bachelor of Computer Science, September 2016 - July 2020
   - **Nanyang Technological University Singapore**
  > GEM Trailblazer Exchange Program, January 2019 - May 2019

## ACADEMIC PROJECTS & EXPERIENCE
### Sketch-based Image Retrieval Using Region Proposal Network
>May 2019 - October 2019. Research project in the summer research internship 2019, faculty of Engineering, CUHK.
- Supervised by Prof. WONG Tien-Tsin and Ms. XIE Minshan.
- Introduce a method to convert style of extracted manga sketch line into uniformed hand sketches by buildingup a CycleGAN model with new loss terms.
- Using Region Proposal Network to retrieve hand sketch query on Manga109 dataset on neural-based imagefeatures to get perceptual searching results.
- Design an effective neural based compression method to compress extracted multi-layer features.

### Portrait Style Transfer Using Neural Network
>September 2019 - May 2020. Ongoing ELITE stream final year project, CUHK.
- Supervised by Prof. WONG Tien-Tsin.
- Build a neural based style transfer with face alignment and reconstruct a VGG feature gainmap betweeninput and style portraits. A VGG feature decoder is applied.
- Implement the StyLit algorithm to generate high-frequency texture detail on the neural based transfer output.

### Pattern Analysis and Score Model in Mahjong Games
>June 2018 - November 2018. Research project in the summer research internship 2018, faculty of Engineering, CUHK.
- Supervised by Prof. CHEN Minghua and Dr. YI Hanling.
- Data analysis on special tile combinations, extraction of tile patterns in Mahjong games.
- Construct a scoring model based on patterns to measure the distance and score expectation of a hand of tiles.
