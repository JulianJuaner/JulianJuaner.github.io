              This study targets a critical aspect of multi-modal LLMs' (LLMs&VLMs) inference: <span
                style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">explicit controllable text generation</span>. Multi-modal
              LLMs empower multi-modality understanding with the capability of semantic generation yet bring less
              explainability and heavier reliance on prompt contents due to their autoregressive generative nature.
              <span style="background-color: rgb(249, 246, 217);">While manipulating prompt formats could improve
                outputs, designing specific and precise prompts per task can be challenging and ineffective. To tackle
                this issue, we introduce a novel inference method, Prompt Highlighter, which enables users to highlight
                specific prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation.</span>
              Motivated by the classifier-free diffusion guidance, we form regular and unconditional context pairs based
              on highlighted tokens, demonstrating that the autoregressive generation in models can be guided in a
              classifier-free way. Notably, we find that, during inference, guiding the models with highlighted tokens
              through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Our approach is compatible with current LLMs
              and VLMs, achieving impressive customized generation results without training. Experiments confirm its
              effectiveness in focusing on input contexts and generating reliable content. <span

                the MMBench test and 1552.5 in MME-perception.</span>

Eat a variety of whole, unprocessed foods: Focus on eating a diet that consists of a variety of whole, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid processed and packaged foods that are high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium.<br>2. Keep track of your calorie intake: To lose weight, you need to be aware of the number of calories you are consuming. Keep a food diary or use a calorie tracking app to keep track of your daily intake. This will help you make sure you are staying within your calorie goals.<br>3. Eat plenty of fiber: Fiber is key for weight loss as it helps you feel full and satisfied, and also helps to regulate digestion. Aim for plenty of fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.<br>4. Drink plenty of water: Drinking enough water is important for overall health and can also help with weight loss. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day.<br>5. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity is an important part of a weight loss and overall healthy living. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day, such as brisk walking, cycling or swimming.<br>6. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can lead to weight gain and make it harder to stick to a healthy diet and exercise plan. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.<br>7. Be mindful of portion sizes: Pay attention to portion sizes, even with healthy foods. Eating too much of even the best foods can still lead to weight gain.<br>8. Plan ahead: Plan your meals in advance and take healthy snacks with you to work or on the go to avoid reaching for unhealthy snacks.<br>9. Get professional help: If you need help with weight loss, consider consulting a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice and support.<br>10. Be patient and consistent: Remember that weight loss takes time and effort. Be patient and consistent with your healthy habits and celebrate your progress along the way.<br>
